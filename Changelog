- experimental Nvidia GPU versions for "elpa_invert_trm" and "elpa_cholesky"
  can be tested by setting elpa_set("gpu_invert_trm",1) and

Changelog for ELPA 2021.05.001

  unclear; only tested --with-mpi=0
- On request, ELPA can print the pinning of MPI tasks and OpenMP thread
- support for FUGAKU: some minor fix still have to be fixed due to compiler
issues
- BUG FIX: if matrix is already banded, check whether bandwidth >= 2. DO NOT
  ALLOW a bandwidth = 1, since this would imply that the input matrix is
  already diagonal which the ELPA algorithms do not support
- BUG FIX in internal test programs: do not consider a residual of 0.0 to be
  an error
- support for skew-symmetric matrices now enabled by default
- BUG FIX in generalized case: in setups like "mpiexec -np 4 ./validate_real_double_generalized_1stage_random 90 90 45`
- ELPA_SETUPS does now (in case of MPI-runs) check whether the user-provided BLACSGRID is reasonable (i.e. ELPA does 
  _not_ rely anymore that the user does check prior to calling ELPA whether the BLACSGRID is ok) if this check fails 
  then ELPA returns with an error
- limit number of OpenMP threads to one, if MPI thread level is not at least MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED
- allow checking of the supported threading level of the MPI library at build time

- more extensive tests during "make check"
- distribute missing C headers
- introduce analytic tests
- Fix stack overflow in some kernels

Changelog for ELPA 2017.05.001.rc2

This is the release candidate 2 for the ELPA 2017.05.001 version.
Additionaly to the changes from rc1, it fixes some smaller issues
- add missing script "manual_cpp"
- cleanup of code

Changelog for ELPA 2017.05.001.rc1

This is the release candidate 1 for the ELPA 2017.05.001 version.
It provides a first version of the new, more generic API of the ELPA library.
Smaller changes to the API might be possible in the upcoming release
candidates. For users, who would like to use the older API of the ELPA
library, the API as defined with release 2016.11.001.pre is frozen in and
also supported.

Apart of the API change to be more flexible for the future, this release
offers the following changes:

- faster GPU implementation, especially for ELPA 1stage
- the restriction of the block-cyclic distribution blocksize = 128 in the GPU
  case is relaxed
- Faster CPU implementation due to better blocking
- support of already banded matrices (new API only!)
- improved KNL support

Changelog for pre-release ELPA 2016.11.001.pre

This pre-release contains an experimental API which will most likely
change in the next stable release

- also suport of single-precision (real and complex case) eigenvalule problems
