Changelog for ELPA 2017.05.001

Final release of ELPA 2017.05.001
Since rc2 the following changes have been made
- more extensive tests during "make check"
- distribute missing C headers
- introduce analytic tests
- Fix stack overflow in some kernels

Changelog for ELPA 2017.05.001.rc2

This is the release candidate 2 for the ELPA 2017.05.001 version.
Additionaly to the changes from rc1, it fixes some smaller issues
- add missing script "manual_cpp"
- cleanup of code

Changelog for ELPA 2017.05.001.rc1

This is the release candidate 1 for the ELPA 2017.05.001 version.
It provides a first version of the new, more generic API of the ELPA library.
Smaller changes to the API might be possible in the upcoming release
candidates. For users, who would like to use the older API of the ELPA
library, the API as defined with release 2016.11.001.pre is frozen in and
also supported.

Apart of the API change to be more flexible for the future, this release
offers the following changes:

- faster GPU implementation, especially for ELPA 1stage
- the restriction of the block-cyclic distribution blocksize = 128 in the GPU
  case is relaxed
- Faster CPU implementation due to better blocking
- support of already banded matrices (new API only!)
- improved KNL support

Changelog for pre-release ELPA 2016.11.001.pre

This pre-release contains an experimental API which will most likely
change in the next stable release

- also suport of single-precision (real and complex case) eigenvalule problems
- GPU support in ELPA 1stage and 2stage (real and complex case)
- change of API (w.r.t. ELPA 2016.05.004) to support runtime-choice of GPU usage

Changelog for release ELPA 2016.05.004

- fix a problem with the private state of module precision
- distribute test_project with dist tarball
- generic driver routine for ELPA 1stage and 2stage
- test case for elpa_mult_at_b_real
- test case for elpa_mult_ah_b_complex
- test case for elpa_cholesky_real
- test case for elpa_cholesky_complex
- test case for elpa_invert_trm_real
- test case for elpa_invert_trm_complex
- fix building of static library
- better choice of AVX, AVX2, AVX512 kernels
- make assumed size Fortran arrays default

Changelog for release ELPA 2016.05.003

- fix a problem with the build of SSE kernels
- make some (internal) functions public, such that they
  can be used outside of ELPA
- add documentation and interfaces for new public functions
- shorten file namses and directory names for test programs
  in under to by pass "make agrument list too long" error

Changelog for release ELPA 2016.05.002

- fix problem with generated *.sh- check scripts
- name library differently if build without MPI support
- install only public modules

- support building without MPI for one node usage
- doxygen and man pages documentation for ELPA
- cleanup of documentation
- introduction of SSE gcc intrinsic kernels
- Remove errors due to unaligned memory
- removal of Fortran "contains functions"
- Fortran interfaces for assembly and C kernels
